>>
...training data
...testing data
...real  future predicts


linear regression
{{tv adver..

newspaper adver
& sales example}}

correlation =0 alternative hypothesis
corr !=0 null hypothesis

> data transformation if  required....(logarthmic transformation)...to apply linear transformation if required

y= mx +c
y,x are data points
m,c you need to find to create your model...which has least errors
mc can be dervied using 
....OLS(oridinary least square )method
.....conjugate gradient method

> statistics
RSE...Residual  standard errors
RMSE... Residual mean square error
Adjusted R^2
