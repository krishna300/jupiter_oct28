hypothesis testing

compare two fertizer grown crops(get random sample)
>but more samples(get mean)
>some are exceptional samples(get standard deviation)

null hypothesis,,,alternate hypothesis

in getting new fertilizer 
tobe working better means ...alternate hypothesis tobe satisfied

in expecting good customers 
you predicted to be close to actual results ....null hypothesis to be satisfied

a motor bikke said mileage is 125
but compteitors said it is less than 125
null hypo ...=1
alternate hypo...<1

The alternate hypothesis is just an alternative to the null. For example, 
if your null is “I'm going to win up to $1000” then your alternate is “I'm going to win more 
than $1000.” Basically, you're looking at whether 
there's enough change (with the alternate hypothesis) to be able to reject the null hypothesis
